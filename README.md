## Hello,

welcome to my first portfolio. In this project we utilized our knowledge of html, css and bootstrap. you can see I created a nav bar thumbnail and form using the bootstrap assets and have an area on my projects page to show some of my work as I create more cool stuff.

During this project I started out by creating page by page and using bootstraps grid system. I found this very helpful in centering and aligning text and images, and was able to reuse a css style sheet since most of bootstrap components have the ability to be adjusted via inline.
